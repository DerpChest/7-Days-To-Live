# 7-Days-To-Live
A Crappy Visual Novel In Ren'Py

Do you know what sucks? Getting diagnosed with a fictional cancer called "7daystoliveitis". It is a cancer that completely destroys your body in 7 days. In Your 7 days, you get to say good bye to all of your friends and loved ones. You even get to go to a trip to Tennessee!

Most of the music were taken from Kevin Macleod Or Self Made.

Before running the game, please extract extractme.zip in the files so the game can run. this is a workaround because github can't process up to 100 files at once. 

To Compile This game, you need to download Ren'Py 7.4.8 "https://www.renpy.org/release/7.4.8". Trying to use Older Or Newer versions and cause you to run into errors.

You can distribute this game to websites like Newgrounds or Itch.io. But please be a giga chad and credit me. Or else we will run into some problems.

Thanks!

 And BTW, if you just want to play the game, go to the GameJolt Page "https://gamejolt.com/games/7DaysToLive/548381"!
